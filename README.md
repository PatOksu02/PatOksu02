## 🚀 Hands-On Lab Projects

### 0. Lab Infrastructure & Virtualization
To facilitate safe security testing, I engineered an isolated virtual network consisting of an attacking machine (Kali Linux) and a vulnerable target (Metasploitable 2).

### 1. Network Vulnerability Assessment (Nmap)
I utilized Nmap for active reconnaissance and service version detection to identify legacy protocol vulnerabilities.

### 2. Enterprise Vulnerability Management (Nessus)
I deployed Nessus Essentials to automate threat detection, prioritizing remediation based on CVSS severity scores.

### 3. Traffic Forensics & Protocol Auditing (Wireshark)
I performed Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to demonstrate the risks of unencrypted traffic and credential theft.
